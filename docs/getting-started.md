# Welcome to the AnyDev library
This library is designed to speedup building AnyLogic models via certain helper functions and blocks.

The library provides 3 components:
- Library blocks: these can be draged from the library palette like any normal AnyLogic block
- functions: These are "hidden" in pure Java classes that you gain access to. You can simply call them from anywhere anytime (i.e. `SanityCheck.that...`)
- Example constructs: These are pre-build models with re-usable content (i.e. experiments...)
...
